RIP FUDGE - Andy Ralton
<(-'.'-<) (>-'.'-)>

Description:

	RIPFuge is a simple application that can be used 
	to generate RIP (Routing Information Protocol) Datagrams.
	
	The Routing Information Protocol is a routing protocol used
	to propergate routes around a network. In it's earliest
	implementation routers would spam the network with 
	"updates" that contained all the routes in their routing table.
	Later versions of the protocol added authentication as well as
	classlessness (Subnetting) and request/response route updates.
	It is the simplest routing protocol, however due to the fact
	that it is extremley easy to use, it is still fairly prevelant.

Usage: 

	./ripfudge [ -aAVvcrsnNpmt ]
		[ -a Address Family ]
		[ -A Authentication Type ]
		[ -v Version ]
		[ -c Command ]
		[ -r Route Tags ]
		[ -s Subnet Mask ]
		[-n Network IP Address (Destination Network) ]
		[ -N Next Hop ]
		[ -p Password ]
		[ -m Metric (Hops) ]
		[ -t Target (Usually either Router IP or Subnet Broadcast Address) ]

Options: 

	Address Family: This is the Network Layer Protocol.etc

	Authentication Type: Type of authentication securing
		RIP on the target router(s).

	Version: This is the RIP version. RIPv1 or RIPv2.

	Verbose: Display verbose program messages. 

	Command: This is the RIP Command value, 2 for Response.

	Route Tags: Optional Route Tags for RIPv2

	Subnet Mask: The subnet mask is used to determine the host 
		and network parts of the Network IP Address.

	Network IP Address: The IP Address of the network 
		you are descriping a route to.

	Next Hop: This is the IP Address of the router which you 
		want the route to point to.

	Password: In the case of auth type 2, this will hold the 
		plain text password.

	Metric: The metric for RIP is "hop count". Which is the number of 
		routers between the target and the network.

	Target: This will be the IP that the packet is send to 
		usually either a router, or a broadcast address.
